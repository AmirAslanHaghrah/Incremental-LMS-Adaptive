# Incremental-LMS-Adaptive
C++ code for Analysis of Incremental LMS Adaptive Algorithm over Wireless Sensor Networks with Delayed Links


Distributed Incremental LMS algorithm over wireless sensor network with delayed links. 
The Recently proposed adaptive networks in literature assume perfect links, which means no consideration is made about delay in the links. The proposed scheme in this article extend existing formulation to study the behavior of incremental adaptive networks in presence of delayed-links between nodes. In this paper wighted spatial-temporal energy conservation method is used to evaluate transient and steady state performance of adaptive networks with delayed-links without any restriction on regressors distribution. The equations that illustrates mean square deviation (MSD), excess mean square error (EMSE) and mean square error (MSE) behavior of individual nodes in network are drived. Also simulations show that with delayedlinks, nodes can be made idle in some iterations without affecting performance of the network which can improve power management strategies. Eventually, it is shown that simulation results have good match with derived theoretical expressions.
